===============
Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can find a single document in a collection using the ``FindOne()`` method.

This example calls the ``FindOne()`` method with a *query filter*. A query
filter contains the criteria for which documents to match. In this example,
the query filter matches documents in the ``movies`` collection that have
the value "The Room" in the ``title`` field. ``FindOne()`` will return the
first document that matches the filter.

   :end-before: end findOneUsageExample

Expected Output
---------------

When executed against a MongoDB cluster loaded with the :atlas:`sample dataset <sample-data>`,
the example will print out a single document similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json

   // results truncated
   {
       "title": "The Room",
       "writers": [
           "Tommy Wiseau"
       ],
       ...
   }
